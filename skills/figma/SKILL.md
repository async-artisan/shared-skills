# Figma MCP

Use the Figma MCP server for Figma-driven implementation. For setup and debugging details (env vars, config, verification), see `references/figma-mcp-config.md`.

## Figma MCP Integration Rules
These rules define the recommended evidence path for Figma-driven changes. Use the full sequence
when fidelity matters or the user requests it; for a quick prototype, fetch only the context needed
to make the next decision and state what was not inspected.

### Standard flow
1. Run get_design_context first to fetch the structured representation for the exact node(s).
2. If the response is too large or truncated, run get_metadata to get the high-level node map and then re-fetch only the required node(s) with get_design_context.
3. Run get_screenshot for a visual reference of the node variant being implemented.
4. Download assets after the context needed for the implementation is available; obtain a screenshot before final visual sign-off when fidelity matters.
5. Translate the output (usually React + Tailwind) into this project's conventions, styles and framework. Reuse the project's color tokens, components, and typography wherever possible.
6. Validate against Figma when the requested outcome includes visual parity; otherwise validate the requested behavior and document the fidelity scope.

### Implementation rules
- Treat the Figma MCP output (React + Tailwind) as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style.
- Replace Tailwind utility classes with the project's preferred utilities/design-system tokens when applicable.
- Reuse existing components (e.g., buttons, inputs, typography, icon wrappers) instead of duplicating functionality.
- Use the project's color system, typography scale, and spacing tokens consistently.
- Respect existing routing, state management, and data-fetch patterns already adopted in the repo.
- Strive for 1:1 visual parity with the Figma design. When conflicts arise, prefer design-system tokens and adjust spacing or sizes minimally to match visuals.
- Validate the final UI against the Figma screenshot for both look and behavior.

### Asset handling
- The Figma MCP Server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets.
- If the Figma MCP Server returns a localhost source for an image or an SVG, prefer that source.
- Do not add icon packages when the Figma payload already supplies the needed asset.
- Do not create placeholders when the user expects fidelity and a usable source is available.

### Link-based prompting
- The server is link-based: copy the Figma frame/layer link and give that URL to the MCP client when asking for implementation help.
- The client cannot browse the URL but extracts the node ID from the link; always ensure the link points to the exact node/variant you want.
